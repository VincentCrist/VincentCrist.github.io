      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This article goes 
      over what WHOOP does, what it tracks the prices of memberships and how it tracks stuff through a 
      band on your arm.  Whoop is mainly used for athletes to track their data during practices, games 
      and at home. Using this data the player can determine if they did too much or too little during 
      the practice or game and can change their approach next game or practice. The thing that some
       people may not like about this is the price, for the product it is $230, and for the 1 year 
       membership it is another $230 so just for the first year it is $460.</small><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>This article tells people how the new technology in baseball, the pitch com works. The pitchcom is a wearable speaker that goes right above a pitcher's ear and relays what pitch is going to be thrown. The catcher wears a 9 button keypad on his shin guard and a receiver that is worn in his helmet like the pitcher. With those 3 devices 3 additional players on the field can wear one also to tell them what pitch is coming. This is a newer tech in baseball and it was implemented because in 2019 the Houston Astros saw the catcher's signs to the pitcher and told the batter what pitch will be coming. And this sign stealing has been going on forever from little league all the way up to the pros.
